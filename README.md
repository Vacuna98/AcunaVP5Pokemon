Project #5 Pokemon

Created a app that displays pokemon character along with its possible moves, abilities, elements, and location. The user is also able to create a favorites list and click on image to change the image from shiny to unshiny.

Peer Reviewer: I like the background image and layout you chose for your Pokemon project. Your search is working and all information shows up as well when searching by either name or id number. There is a small issue I noticed, there is no way to get a Pokemon entry at random. Other than that, project looks good and your local storage is working as well.
